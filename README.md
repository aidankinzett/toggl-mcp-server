# Toggl MCP Server

Allows MCP clients to interact with Toggl Track, enabling time tracking, project management, and workspace operations through natural language.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Toggl Track account
- uv installed for dependency management

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside of the `mcp_toggl_server` folder with either:

```bash
EMAIL=your_toggl_email
PASSWORD=your_toggl_password
```

or

```bash
TOGGL_API_TOKEN=***
```

### Installation

First install uv: - For MacOS/Linux:
`bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        ` - For Windows:
`bash
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
        `

Make sure to restart your terminal afterwards to ensure that the uv command gets picked up.

Now let's clone the repository and set up the project:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd toggl-mcp-server/toggl-mcp-server
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

### Integration with Development Tools

#### VS Code + GitHub Copilot Setup

1. Configure the MCP Server in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
"servers": {
  "toggl": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "--directory",
      "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/toggl-mcp-server",
      "run",
      "toggl_mcp_server.py"],
    "envFile": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/toggl-mcp-server/.env"
  }
}
```

2. Update the configuration:

   - Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/toggl-mcp-server` with the absolute path to the server
   - You may need to put the full path to the uv executable in the command field. You can get this by running which uv on MacOS/Linux or where uv on Windows

3. Enable the server:
   - Look for the start button when hovering over the server configuration `/.vscode/mcp.json`
   - Click start to let Copilot discover available tools
   - Switch to agent mode in Copilot

For detailed setup instructions, see:

- [MCP Servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- [Copilot Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)

### Additional MCP Client Integration

The Toggl MCP Server works with any MCP-compatible client. For integration steps:

1. For Claude Desktop, visit the [MCP Quick Start Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
2. For other MCP clients, consult their respective documentation for server configuration

Note: Configuration typically involves specifying the server path and environment variables similar to the VS Code setup above.

### Testing with MCP Inspector

To run in development:

```bash
EMAIL=your_toggl_email PASSWORD=your_toggl_password mcp dev toggl_mcp_server.py
```
